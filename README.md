This repository contains an implementation for the paper "Fine-Grained Normal Estimation via Feature-Augmented Knowledge Transfer".

Surface normal estimation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep learning. However, existing models often struggle to preserve fine-grained geometric details, particularly in challenging real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a novel feature-augmented knowledge transfer framework that enhances surface normal estimation through knowledge distillation. Our approach employs a teacher-student paradigm in which the student model learns to replicate the teacher's predictions while being guided by structural features extracted from a pre-trained image encoder. Specifically, we introduce two complementary modules: (1) a geometry-aware distillation mechanism that transfers geometric priors from the teacher to the student, improving the reconstruction of subtle surface variations; and (2) a feature-guided consistency loss that aligns the student's predicted normals with image-derived features to reinforce local structural fidelity. This dual supervision enables the student to produce sharper and more accurate normal maps, even under limited supervision. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in retaining high-frequency surface details. Our framework provides a general and effective solution for fine-grained normal estimation with flexible models. Code will be made publicly available.
